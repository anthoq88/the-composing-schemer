# The Composing Schemer

This is a small experiment for me to understand tonal melodies, using Overtone, Quil and core.logic. For a demonstration, see [this video](https://vimeo.com/55677313). [This blog post](http://tgk.github.com/2012/12/the-composing-schemer.html) explains most of the code.

Happy (musical) hacking!
